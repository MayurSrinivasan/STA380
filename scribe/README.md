# STA 380 (Part 2): Scribe Notes

### Exploratory Analysis

[Module 1 notes here](https://github.com/MatthewBrugman/July-30-Scribe-Notes/blob/master/July30Notes.md), by Matthew Brugman, Kathleen Paski, and Yuwen Wang.


### Sampling distributions, bootstrapping

[Module 2 notes here](ScribeNotes_Module2.pdf), by Charles Aldrich and Gregory Merchant.  [RMarkdown file here](ScribeNotes_Module2.Rmd).

Note: my "module numbering scheme" was ambiguous.  Thus Module 2 and 3 are actually the same, and from here it's numbered starting at 4.


### More on bootstrapping, permutation tests, bootstrapping

[Module 4 notes here](https://github.com/mzhang07/mzhang/blob/master/Scribe_Notes_Module%204_Chu_Wolfe_Zhang.pdf), by Chu, Wolfe, and Zhang.
